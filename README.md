# Docker images for selenium grid extras Hub and Node with Chrome and Firefox

Images included:

- __minium/selenium-grid-extras-hub__: Image for running grid extras hub. Based on Alpine
- __minium/selenium-grid-extras-base__: Base images for selenium nodes. Based on Ubuntu LTS
- __minium/selenium-grid-extras-chrome__: Selenium Grid Extras Node with Chrome Latest
- __minium/selenium-grid-extras-firefox__: Selenium Grid Extras Node with Firefox Latest (x86_64)

All images are versioned after the [Selenium-Grid-Extras](https://github.com/groupon/Selenium-Grid-Extras) release number.

The images can be found in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/minium/)

## Running the images

The easiest way is to run with docker-compose. There is at the root of the project a compose file (`hub-chrome-firefox.yml`) for running a Hub with 2 connected Nodes running Chrome and Firefox as an example:

``` bash
docker-compose -f hub-chrome-firefox.yml up 
```

Obviously you can also use the same configuration with just plain docker command line.

### Node tag explanation

The tag of the selenium nodes are composed by \<selenium version>-\<selenium grid extras version>-\<browser version> (e.g. **minium/selenium-grid-extras-chrome:3.8.1-2.0.4-70.0**)


## Configuring the containers

### JAVA_OPTS Java Environment Options

You can pass `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to java process in the docker command line, or by editing your docker-compose:

``` bash
    environment:
      - JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
```

### SE_OPTS Selenium Configuration Options

You can pass `SE_OPTS` variable with additional commandline parameters for starting a hub or a node.

``` bash
    environment:
      - SE_OPTS=-debug true   
```

## Building the images

Clone the repo and from inside of each directoy you can build using docker-compose:

``` bash
docker-compose build
```

Keep in mind the `NodeBase` needs to be built before `NodeChrome` and `NodeFirefox`

Using Makefile to build all:

``` bash
SELENIUM_VERSION=3.8.1 SELENIUM_GRID_EXTRAS_VERSION=2.0.4 CHROME_VERSION=70.0 FIREFOX_VERSION=63.0 make build
```

## Troubleshooting

In case you need to troubleshoot you can change LOG levels of different components, by changing your docker enviornments or providing a `log4j.properties`

```
    environment:
      - SE_OPTS=-debug true   
    volumes:
       - ./log4j.properties:/opt/selenium/log4j.properties
```
